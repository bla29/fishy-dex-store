# Fishy-Dex-Store

Fishy-Dex-Store is a collection of API's used to work with the Fishy-Dex front-end application. It enables basic CRUD functionality on the website.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone git@github.com:bla29/fishy-dex-store.git

2. Install dependencies:

    bundle install

3. Set up the database:

    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate

4. Start the application:

    rails server

## Testing

    I've currently written tests to validate model validations in fish.rb, as well as functional tests for fish_controller.rb to ensure that all API's are working.
    
    To run test:

    bin/rails test

## Status

    This project is currently in **active development**. I am adding new features and fixing any potential bugs.
